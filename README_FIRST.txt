CS690V: Midterm
Submitted by: Divyesh Harit. Not part of the group, as Moodle says.

Dataset used: A UK-specific twitter dataset from last year.

NOTES:
1. I was having some technical difficulties so I made the notebook in Python 2.7 instead of what I've been doing before this - 3.5. Please take that into consideration while running the notebook.
2. Just a heads up: I'm not sure what the specs of the machine this will be tested on are, but this might work best on an Edlab machine. There are around ~170k tweets and a total of 1.5 million+ words. While this is by no means huge, I ran into some performance problems on my modest machine. While interacting using slider, it's taking a lot of time to actually compute and display, and ended up using around 4gigs of ram at one point.
